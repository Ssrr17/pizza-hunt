//Here we're using the .reduce() method to tally up the total of every comment with its replies. In its basic form, .reduce() 
//takes two parameters, an accumulator and a currentValue. Here, the accumulator is total, and the currentValue is comment. 
//As .reduce() walks through the array, it passes the accumulating total and the current value of comment into the function, 
//with the return of the function revising the total for the next iteration through the array.
